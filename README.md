### Overview

This is a user-centric static website for Sabrina Cardani and Elisabetta Schiavini, two ceramic artists based in Italy.
As the artists are Italian, the website has both an English and Italian version.
It is designed to be responsive on all devices (desktop screens, tablets and smartphones). 
Their ceramics and artworks are not expensive, their products are accessible to everyone. What separates *To Press* products from their competitors is that they are tailored to the customers specifics needs.   

I will not be adopting a B2C strategy for this website. A B2C website aims to trigger the customer to make an impulsive purchase using a three steps rule of thumb. I have decided this is not appropriate for this artistic project. The business goal is to establish an individual relationship with the client diversifying its offer. This increases customer satisfaction. The client buying an exclusive and unique product feels to be important and special.  

The website aims to allow customer/s to get in touch with the artists by using a contact form that is clear and accessible. The website aims to be transparent showing the prices of artworks and ceramics. The main goal of the website is to sell the creations of the artists, whilst generates an online presence that also builds trust among potential customers or followers on social media pages.

## Strategy
The aim of this project is to spread awareness of the two ceramists leading the users to contact them via a contact form or through their social media pages.

The business goals of this website in order of importance are:
1. Create an online presence for the two local artists and increase consumer awareness.
2. Allow potential clients to buy the artworks via a contact form.
3. Create new opportunities of collaboration with designers and other artists.
4. Showcase the artists' story and activities to build consumer trust.
5. Increase number of followers on the artists social media pages.

The customers goals of this website are:
1. View and inspect the artworks, the product specifics and prices.
2. Ask for a personalized and customized product. 
3. Place an order quickly, intuitively and easily.
4. Sign up for a newsletter to stay updated on their creations.

## Scope
I want to offer to the users an overview of the artists mission, artworks and portfolio. The scope of this project is to keep them interested and engaged until they make the decision to get in touch with the artists filling a contact form.
Following a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) scheme this website wants to accomplish:
- Clarity.
- Simplicity.
- Respect users expectations and confidence.

## Structure
The information is organized to offer an intuitive interaction to the users.
The paragraphs with contents and information are not too dense and packed.
The structure is simple and follows a linear narrative. This allows the users to navigate themselves to the 'Contact us' page keeping their attention with a good UX design.

## Surface
**Design Scheme**

It plays with neutral light colours which invoke earth-tones and clay's hues:

* I've chosen a light beige color (#efe7db) for backgrounds because I picked it from this picture of their ceramics ![Ceramic leaves](/assets/images/ToPress-leaves.png "Ceramic leaves") using the Website [Ginifab](https://www.ginifab.com/feeds/pms/pms_color_in_image.php).
* I've used Light Slate Gray (#778899) for body-text to make it outstanding and because evokes clay's color.
* I've chosen Porcelain color (#e8e9ea) for the navigation bar background and the footer.
* I've chosen Benjamin Moore Red color (#ca2f2f) for the links in the navbar and for the main headings because reminds the color of their logo.

**Typography**
* "Fredericka the Great" font ("Exo" as fallback font) for headings. I've chosen this font for its artistic and clear aspect.
* "Josefin Slab" font ("Cormorant" as fallback font) for body content. I've chosen this font for its elegant design.

**Imagery**

The images have been carefully selected to be eye-catching, appealing and compelling. The purpose is to showcase the most recent and important pieces created by the artists. The artists want the images to clearly show that is possible to personalize the product/object on request. They also wish to transmit that they are ceramic makers and that the decoration aspect is an additional value.

### Testing users stories 
1. As a **First Time Visitor** of the website I want to learn more about the artists, their mission and what they do. The common path is: starting from the "Home page", read the mission and press the call to action button "read more" to dive into the information of the artists in the "About us page" and see their activities and facilities. Usually a first time visitor wants to explore the gallery of artworks to evaluate the quality and is here that he/she decides if is interested or not in purchasing. The user can view and find easily all the pages thanks to a clear, linear and labelled navigation bar.
From every page pressing on the logo in the navigation bar the user can go back to the home page. The first time visitor can choose the preferred language by clicking the buttons EN-ITA in the navbar. 
2. As a **Returning Visitor** I am interested to buy an artwork that I have previously viewed on the "Gallery page" so clicking on "Contact us" I can fill the contact form. Another way to contact the artists is through the social media icons links in the footer. The third way is to download their brochure and here there are their contact information: phone number and email address. A Returning Visitor could be interested about the personalization option so after visiting the page "Personalize your product" can contact the artists with the same procedure.
3. As a **Frequent Visitor** I want to stay updated on the artists new creations so after visiting the "Gallery" page to see if there are new artworks, I sign up for the newsletter placed in the footer.
4. As a **Local Artist** I look for collaboration projects or commit to the artists the production of ceramic series. I go straight to the "Contact us" page because I probably already know personally the artists otherwise after visiting the "About us" page I proceed to contact them. 

### Manual functional testing
#### Home page
- Navigation Bar: hovering over the logo appears the title attribute (to-press logo). Only with alt attribute the text didn't appear. Hovering over the pages' label appears the hover shadow transition and the pages' names turn into red. The navbar language buttons (EN-ITA) are on every page and they link to the respective italian html page. Hovering over them they turn into red and clicking on EN becomes light-grey (btn-light) and on ITA becomes dark-grey (btn-dark) as I used Bootstrap button styles. At the breakpoint of (max-width: 575.98px) the navbar transforms into a toggle menu and clicking the burger icon it opens a collapsible centered menu. The language buttons are on the left side of the collapsible menu but if the toggle menu is closed they are visible under the logo.
- Hero-video: is looped, muted and it auto plays. It is 100% width. The overlay box with the title is responsive changing the screen sizes as I styled it with media queries.
- Call to action button "Read more": hovering over it turns into Porcelain color, the same color of the navbar and the footer. If pressed it links and brings to the "About us" page.
- Hero-images: are four of the artists most recent creations. I used Fancybox to display these images individually. If we click on one image it opens Fancybox viewer and allows us to move back and forward with the arrows, to zoom an image, to start a slideshow or to open the thumbnails gallery. Every image has a name and the copyright thanks to the data-caption attribute. On phone screens I used col-6 Bootstrap grid system to place two images side by side.
- Testimonials: are three reviews on large screens and two on phone screens as I used Bootstrap display property ().
- Footer: testing the Newsletter if I insert an invalid email address an error message suggests what is missing (the @ or the . dot or the first part of the email). If I try to sign up leaving the email address field empty an error message says "fill in this field". If I insert a valid email address and I press "Sign up" it reloads the page.  
Hovering the "Sign up" button it turns the same color used for the background.
The social media links get open in a new tab using target="_blank" and hovering over their icons they turn into red and transform their sizes slightly bigger. The footer is responsive and at the breakpoint of (max-width: 767.98px) the three columns are ordered vertically inverting the order of social media links and of the copyright. In this way the copyright appears at the bottom of the page.  
#### About us page
- Artists images: hovering over the images of the two artists it shows the title attribute "Sabrina photo" and "Elisabetta photo". With the alt attribute alone the text didn't appear.
- Call to action button "Download our brochure": hovering over it turns into Porcelain color and if is clicked it downloads the pdf file in English or in Italian if you are on "Chi Siamo" page. The files end in your download default folder and to achieve this I used the download attribute.
#### Gallery page
- Gallery Images: I used Fancybox "images-preview" to display only three images for each category. The others three pictures are hidden (display:none attribute) and visible only in the thumbnail gallery. Every image has a name and the copyright thanks to the data-caption attribute. If we click on one image it opens Fancybox viewer and allows us to move back and forward with the arrows, to zoom an image, to start a slideshow or to open the thumbnails gallery. Reducing or expanding the screen size the images behave as expected and are centered. On phone screens the images are occupying the whole width (col-12) and are stacked on top of each other.  
- Call to action button "Place an order": hovering over it turns into Porcelain color and it links to the "Contact us" page.
#### Customize page
- Customize-icons: I used Fontawesome Icons to explain step by step the personalization process. Reducing and expanding the window width the text and the icons adapt responsively.
- Cards-Images: I used Bootstrap cards to explain three options of personalization. The different height is made on purpose to fit the content. The images have different sizes and I didn't like that under the text there was a large empty space. The cards behave with responsiveness reducing the window width and are displayed stacked on top of each other on phone screens.
- Call to action button "Contact us and Design with us": hovering over it turns into Porcelain color and it links to the "Contact us" page.
#### Contact us page
- Form: trying to submit the form with all the fields empty an error message appears saying "fill out this field". Trying to insert an invalid email address an error message suggests which part of the email address is missing. Trying to attach a file or an image the selection process works and the file is uploaded. Trying to fill out the form correctly the form reloads. I added the boolean attribute required to the name, email and text message fields so if they are not filled is not possible to submit the form.
- Call to action button "Submit": hovering over it turns into Porcelain color. If clicked, after have filled out the form it reloads the current page.

### Bugs and challenges during the project
- I run into some issues placing the language buttons in the navigation bar. I tried to place them on the left, next to the logo, but I didn't like this solution and they were falling into the collapsible navbar. After asking an advice to the tutor at Code Institute Igor Basuga I placed them on the right on large screens and now are still in the collapsible navbar but also visible outside it, under the logo, if the toggle menu is not pressed.
- Another challenge has been to insert the newsletter in the footer. The layout wasn't responsive and the footer didn't stay stick to bottom so I tried to insert the newsletter in the "About us" page because is one of the most visited pages but I didn't like the effect. At the end I tried a three columns layout on large screens and to order the items in vertical on phones and tablets. With @media queries I styled the footer to make it responsive.
- On "Gallery" page at the beginning I placed 6 images every row divided into categories on large screens and col-6 on small screens but they seemed to me too many pictures. So I decided to use Fancybox preview which allowed me to display only three images per row on large screens and hide the rest of the pictures. Only if we click an image Fancybox viewer let us see all the collection.
- On "Customize" page I have used Bootstrap cards to present three different typologies of personalization and the different height of the cards is made intentionally and on purpose to fit the text and give a dynamic effect to the page.
