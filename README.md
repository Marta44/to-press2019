### Overview

This is a user-centric static website for Elisabetta Schiavini and Sabrina Cardani, two ceramic artists based in Italy.
As the artists are Italian, the website has both an English and Italian version.
It is designed to be responsive on all devices (desktop screens, tablets and smartphones). 
Their ceramics and artworks are not expensive, their products are accessible to everyone. What separates *To Press* products from their competitors is that they are tailored to the customers specifics needs.   

I will not be adopting a B2C strategy for this website. A B2C website aims to trigger the customer to make an impulsive purchase using a three steps rule of thumb. I have decided this is not appropriate for this artistic project. The business goal is to establish an individual relationship with the client diversifying its offer. This increases customer satisfaction. The client buying an exclusive and unique product feels to be important and special.  

The website aims to allow customer/s to get in touch with the artists by using a contact form that is clear and accessible. The website aims to be transparent showing the prices of artworks and ceramics. The main goal of the website is to sell the creations of the artists, whilst generates an online presence that also builds trust among potential customers or followers on social media pages.
