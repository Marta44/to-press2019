### Overview

This is a user-centric static website for Elisabetta Schiavini and Sabrina Cardani, two ceramic artists based in Italy.
As the artists are Italian, the website has both an English and Italian version.
It is designed to be responsive on all devices (desktop screens, tablets and smartphones). 
Their ceramics and artworks are not expensive, their products are accessible to everyone. What separates *To Press* products from their competitors is that they are tailored to the customers specifics needs.   

I will not be adopting a B2C strategy for this website. A B2C website aims to trigger the customer to make an impulsive purchase using a three steps rule of thumb. I have decided this is not appropriate for this artistic project. The business goal is to establish an individual relationship with the client diversifying its offer. This increases customer satisfaction. The client buying an exclusive and unique product feels to be important and special.  

The website aims to allow customer/s to get in touch with the artists by using a contact form that is clear and accessible. The website aims to be transparent showing the prices of artworks and ceramics. The main goal of the website is to sell the creations of the artists, whilst generates an online presence that also builds trust among potential customers or followers on social media pages.

## Strategy
The aim of this project is to spread awareness of the two ceramists leading the users to contact them via email or through their social media pages.

The business goals of this website in order of importance are:
1. Create an online presence for the two local artists and increase consumer awareness.
2. Allow potential clients to buy the artworks via a contact form.
3. Create new opportunities of collaboration with designers and other artists.
4. Showcase the artists' CV and portfolio to build consumer trust.

The customers goals of this website are:

2. Ask for a personalized and customized product. 
3. Place an order quickly, intuitively and easily.

## Scope
I want to offer to the users an overview of the artists mission, artworks and portfolio. The scope of this project is to keep them interested and engaged until they make the decision to get in touch with the artists filling a contact form.
Following a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) scheme this website wants to accomplish:
- Clarity.
- Simplicity.
- Respect users expectations and confidence.

## Structure
The information is organized to offer an intuitive interaction to the users.
The paragraphs with contents and information are not too dense and packed.
The structure is simple and follows a linear narrative. This allows the users to navigate themselves to the 'Contact us' page keeping their attention with a good UX design.

## Surface
**Design Scheme**

It plays with neutral light colours which invoke earth-tones and clay's hues:

* I've chosen a soft pink (#) for backgrounds.
* I've used a gray (#) for body-text to make it outstanding and in contrast.
* I've chosen off-white (#fafafa) for the navigation bar adding a transition (when the mouse hovers over the text) that turns it into a darker pink (#).
* I've used a darker gray (#) for headings.

**Typography**
* "Fredericka the Great" font ("Exo" as fallback font) for headings. I've chosen this font for its artistic and clear aspect.
* "Josefin Slab" font ("Montserrat" as fallback font) for body content. I've chosen this font for its elegant design.

**Imagery**

The images have been carefully selected to be eye-catching, appealing and compelling. The purpose is to showcase the most recent and important pieces created by the artists. The artists also want the images to clearly show that is possible to personalize the product/object on request.
