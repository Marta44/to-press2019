### Overview

This is a user-centric static website for Sabrina Cardani and Elisabetta Schiavini, two ceramic artists based in Italy.
As the artists are Italian, the website has both an English and Italian version.
It is designed to be responsive on all devices (desktop screens, tablets and smartphones). 
Their ceramics and artworks are not expensive, their products are accessible to everyone. What separates *To Press* products from their competitors is that they are tailored to the customers specifics needs.   

I will not be adopting a B2C strategy for this website. A B2C website aims to trigger the customer to make an impulsive purchase using a three steps rule of thumb. I have decided this is not appropriate for this artistic project. The business goal is to establish an individual relationship with the client diversifying its offer. This increases customer satisfaction. The client buying an exclusive and unique product feels to be important and special.  

The website aims to allow customer/s to get in touch with the artists by using a contact form that is clear and accessible. The website aims to be transparent showing the prices of artworks and ceramics. The main goal of the website is to sell the creations of the artists, whilst generates an online presence that also builds trust among potential customers or followers on social media pages.

## Strategy
The aim of this project is to spread awareness of the two ceramists leading the users to contact them via email or through their social media pages.

The business goals of this website in order of importance are:
1. Create an online presence for the two local artists and increase consumer awareness.
2. Allow potential clients to buy the artworks via a contact form.
3. Create new opportunities of collaboration with designers and other artists.
4. Showcase the artists' CV and portfolio to build consumer trust.
5. Increase number of followers on the artists social media pages.

The customers goals of this website are:
1. View and inspect the artworks, the product specifics and prices.
2. Ask for a personalized and customized product. 
3. Place an order quickly, intuitively and easily.
4. Sign up in a newsletter to stay updated on their creations.

## Scope
I want to offer to the users an overview of the artists mission, artworks and portfolio. The scope of this project is to keep them interested and engaged until they make the decision to get in touch with the artists filling a contact form.
Following a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) scheme this website wants to accomplish:
- Clarity.
- Simplicity.
- Respect users expectations and confidence.

## Structure
The information is organized to offer an intuitive interaction to the users.
The paragraphs with contents and information are not too dense and packed.
The structure is simple and follows a linear narrative. This allows the users to navigate themselves to the 'Contact us' page keeping their attention with a good UX design.

## Surface
**Design Scheme**

It plays with neutral light colours which invoke earth-tones and clay's hues:

* I've chosen Faux-Linen beige color (#f8f1e7) for backgrounds because I picked it from this picture of their ceramics ![Ceramic leaves](/assets/images/ToPress-leaves.png "Ceramic leaves") using this Website [Ginifab](https://www.ginifab.com/feeds/pms/pms_color_in_image.php).
* I've used Light Slate Gray (#778899) for body-text to make it outstanding and because evokes clay's color.
* I've chosen Porcelain color (#e8e9ea) for the navigation bar background and the footer.
* I've chosen Benjamin Moore Red color (#ca2f2f) for the links in the navbar and for the main headings because reminds the color of their logo.

**Typography**
* "Fredericka the Great" font ("Exo" as fallback font) for headings. I've chosen this font for its artistic and clear aspect.
* "Josefin Slab" font ("Cormorant" as fallback font) for body content. I've chosen this font for its elegant design.

**Imagery**

The images have been carefully selected to be eye-catching, appealing and compelling. The purpose is to showcase the most recent and important pieces created by the artists. The artists want the images to clearly show that is possible to personalize the product/object on request. They also wish to transmit that they are ceramic makers and that the decoration aspect is an added value.

## Features
### Existing Features
- Five different and individual pages.
- On every page is present a header logo of the business brand (top-left), if clicked brings the user back to the landing page as they expect.
- On every page is present a header navigation bar, fixed and centered, that allows the user to navigate easily through the different sections.
- On every page is present in the navigation bar a language switcher to select the preferred language (English or Italian).
- On every page is present a fixed footer, which provides a newsletter sign up section(bottom-left), the business copyright info (bottom-center) and social media pages icons (bottom-right), if clicked it brings the user to social media platforms opened on a different tab.
- On every page is present a call to action button which leads the user to the next step.
- On the "Landing page" is present a promotional video of the artists in their studio. It keeps the users engaged and invites them to look through the website's contents.
- On the "About Us" section is provided a downloadable PDF version of the artists' brochure that gets opened in another tab.
- On the "Gallery page" is present a small preview of the artworks, if clicked opens a Fancybox viewer which can enlarge and zoom the image and allows to move back and forward through the images. I have used Fancybox preview so some of the images are hidden. If we click on one of the displayed images we have access to the whole collection.
- On the "Contact page" is present a form which allows users to get in touch with the artists uploading images or files together with their request message.

### Features to add in future
- The contact form submission button has to be functional when pressed and provide a feedback to the users to make them feel assured(Javascript needed).
- Add CAPTCHA, a challenge-response authentication, to the contact form to block spammers and bots (Javascript needed).
- Add General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which protects the Privacy Policy of European Union residents (Javascript needed).
- Add "Ceramic lessons" page. This is a further opportunity for the artists to gain a different income but they need time to organize this activity and to feature its programme.
- Add "Collaborations and projects" page. Once they build up their network and start to collaborate with more artists is important to dedicate to it a specific section.  
- Add a further description in the "About us" page about their education and artistic path.

## Testing
### Bugs and challenges during the project
- I run into some issues placing the language buttons in the navigation bar. I tried to place them on the left, next to the logo, but I didn't like this solution and they were falling into the collapsible navbar. After asking an advice to the tutor Igor Basuga I placed them on the right on large screens and now are still in the collapsible navbar but also visible outside it, under the logo, if the toggle menu is not pressed.
- Another challenge has been to insert the newsletter in the footer. The layout wasn't responsive and the footer didn't stay stick to bottom so I tried to insert the newsletter in the "About us" page because is one of the most visited pages but I didn't like the effect. At the end I tried a three columns layout on large screens and to order the items in vertical on phones and tablets. With @media queries I styled the footer to make it responsive.
-In "Customize" page I used Bootstrap cards to present three different typologies of personalization and the different height of the cards is made intentionally and on purpose to fit the text.
